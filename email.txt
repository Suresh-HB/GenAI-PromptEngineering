Subject: Request For Work from home

Hi,
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request permission to work from home today due to the heavy rainfall in Bengaluru. The current weather conditions are making it challenging for me to commute safely to the office.
I assure you that I will remain fully available and committed to my responsibilities while working remotely. I have all the necessary tools to maintain productivity and will be accessible via email and phone throughout the day.
Thank you for your understanding. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your approval.

Thanks 
Suresh

I will ensure that all my responsibilities are managed in advance and will coordinate with the team to ensure a smooth workflow during my absence. If needed, I can assist in preparing handover notes to facilitate any ongoing projects.
